### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhijeet2242/Booking-System.git

cd booking-system
```
### 2. Configure Database
No need to do it, as I set up this in application.properties. Still for understanding I am providing
```bash
spring.application.name=booking-system

# PostgreSQL connection
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/booking-system-db
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=root
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver

# JPA & Hibernate
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

spring.sql.init.mode=always
spring.sql.init.platform=postgres

server.port=4000
```
### 3. Run Application in Intellij

### API Documentation

Swagger UI is enabled. After running the project, visit:
```bash
ðŸ”— http://localhost:4000/swagger-ui/index.html
````
OpenAPI JSON spec:
```bash
ðŸ”— http://localhost:4000/v3/api-docs
```
Postman API collection for API
```bash
https://www.postman.com/abhi2242/multigenesys/collection/91dx8k5/booking-system

Keep in mind 
1. First hit Register
2. Then login it will store token in cookies as well as in
return also for identifying its works fine
3. then use different routes
